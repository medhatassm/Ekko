### What did I learn when doing this website?
I learned a lot about animation and how I can use it to make my website alive and practiced on grid and flex-box to make my website responsive to any screen size did a lot of modern style with before and after (pseudo-element), and learned more about the transaction and transform to deal with x-axis and y-axis, and a lot of things in this website.
